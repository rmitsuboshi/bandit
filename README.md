# Bandit
A small collection of Bandit algorithms, written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)ðŸ¦€.

This crate provides a generic framework for bandit protocol.
The algorithms in this crate are named 
based on [this book](https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf).


Currently, the following algorithms are implemented.
### Stochastic Bandits
- ETC (Explore-Then-Commit),
- UCB (Upper-Confidence-Bound),
- Asymptotically Optimal UCB (Asymptotically Optimal Upper-Confidence-Bound),

### Adversarial Bandits
Being prepared.


### Environments
- Sub-gaussian environment,
